# Itâ€™s not about reaching for 100% coverage ðŸ¦„


## why no 100%
- you get diminishing returns on your tests as the coverage increases much beyond 70%
- when you strive for 100% all the time, you find yourself spending time testing things that really don't need to be tested
- Maintaining tests like this actually really slow you and your team down.
